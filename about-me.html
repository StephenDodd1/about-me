        <h2>Science and Technology thrill me.<br>And I'm not ashamed to admit it.<br>
        </h2>
        <p> &emsp;My goal is to help each and every one of you enjoy it too.<br>
            In my youth, I found mathematics very boring. I was great at math.<br>
            I enjoyed being great at math. Otherwise, I was unenthusiastic about<br>
            it. It took me years to recognize how exciting mathematics can be!<br>
            I learned that despite the fact that in isolation, the regurgitation<br>
            of low-level mathematics IS excruciatingly boring, mathematics is<br>
            <span>not boring</span>, but in fact, it is thrilling!<br><br>
            &emsp;This boring subject kids are taught in school <span>is not</span> what<br>
            mathematics is, or should be. Unfortunately, many educators and<br>
            policy-makers have had it wrong for a long time.<br><br>
            &emsp;I graduated from the University of North Texas in 2012 with a<br>
            Bachelor of Arts degree in International Studies, with a minor in<br>
            Spanish. I am now a fluent spanish-speaker. The focus of my studies<br>
            was Business, Economics and Development. I studied everything I<br> 
            could, from Cultural Anthropology to Psychology to Marketing.<br>
            Upon graduating, I decided to pursue a Computer Science Degree.<br><br>
            &emsp;While pursuing this Computer Science Degree, I enjoyed working<br>
            in hospitality management. However, I changed course when I <br>
            decided to take up the noble pursuit of teaching. So again, I<br>
            went back to school, and began teaching, eventually obtaining a<br>
            Masters Degree in Mathematics Curriculum and Instruction, and<br>
            I have now been teaching Secondary Mathematics for the past 5 years.<br><br>
            &emsp;Over the past 5 years, I have had the pleasure of teaching many<br>
            wonderful students, from diverse backgrounds, in courses ranging<br>
            from 7th grade Mathematics to Calculus BC(second-year).<br><br>
            &emsp;My favorite pastimes include robotics, technology, science-fiction,<br>
            (mostly of the realistic variety), space, engineering, and generally<br>
            tinkering. I love to read and create programs and watch news and<br>
            trade stocks. <span>Perhaps most of all, I love a good challenge.</span>
